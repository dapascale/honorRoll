Welcome to the Honor Roll !

Intro & Goal

Honor Roll is the first company of its kind, pioneering the upcoming trend of personalized toilet paper rolls. We are offering businesses and individuals the unique opportunity to cultivate their (and their guests’) bathroom experiences in as detailed a way as they have in every other room in their house, office, or building. Whether you want to add a little extra cuteness to your home bathroom, or want to make sure everyone in the office is enveloped by your company’s brand identity, Honor Roll will make you wish you ate where you… well, you get the picture.

But(t) for Whom?

Companies and Businesses that are looking to level-up their brand identities and leave their guests and employees in awe of their top-to-bottom approach to business.

Individuals looking to add an extra level of comfort and coziness to their home bathrooms.

Gift-givers who need something a little quirky and a little off-kilter for the person who has it all.

Why Build It?

We love using it and know that you will, too.

To take early advantage of an untapped market with huge potential profits.

With most of the company working remotely, low startup costs.

To submit as a tech test of sorts to MVM (this has only been applicable in one known case).

User Flow & Experience

Landing page
The landing page for the website will offer some details about the product, as well as testimonials. It will include numerous calls to action to allow the user to sign up.

Sign-up page
The sign-up page takes the users through the relatively simple sign-up process, enabling them to enter in their personal information (all necessary in order to print and ship their custom toilet paper to them.

Plan Selection Page
Upon signing up, users are then redirected to the plan selection page, where they can choose to continue as a free user, or upgrade to a Standard or Premium plan.

Payment Page
After selecting their subscription, the user will be prompted to enter their payment information. After they are successful, they will be able to utilize our full-service toilet paper design platform - or as we like to say, they will be admitted into the Throne Room.

Design decisions
Surrounding what will likely (in its early stages) be a polarizing product, the design of the product is quintessential in reflecting our culture. We wanted the look and feel of the website to represent our sustainability practices and excitement about this product, so we opted for a clean, bright, and whimsical brand design. The crisp whites and blues should evoke the feel of a pristine restroom, and the light purple should lend the fresh, vibrant feeling that lavender brings into a room. The toilet paper dancing in the background should work to subtly give the user a sense of excitement and movement, and usher them forward in their subscription process.
